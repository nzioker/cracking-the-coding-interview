# cracking-the-coding-interview
This repository contains the solutions that I've worked out from the book, Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann.
While I may not say that I got all answers from my thining, where I failed I researched to se what I didn't do correctly.
In some instances I've left my solution which doesnt fully solve the problem just to show my train of thought. Underneath it though is the working solution
that I found after some research.
